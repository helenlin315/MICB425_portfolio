# Module 01
Reserve the first level headings (#) for the start of a new Module. This will help to organize your portfolio in an intuitive fashion.  
**Note: Please edit this template to your heart's content. This is meant to be the armature upon which you build your individual portfolio. You do not need to keep this instructive text in your final portfolio, although you do need to keep module and assignment names so we can identify what is what.**


## Module 01 portfolio check
The first of your second level headers (##) is to be used for the portfolio content checks. The Module 01 portfolio check has been built for you directly into this template, but will also be available as a stand-alone markdown document available on the MICB425 GitHub so that you know what is required in each module section in your portfolio. The completion status and comments will be filled in by the instructors during portfolio checks when your current portfolios are pulled from GitHub.

## Data science Friday  
The remaining second level headers (##) are for separating data science Friday, regular course, and project content. In this module, you will only need to include data science Friday and regular course content; projects will come later in the course.

### Installation check
Third level headers (###) should be used for links to assignments, evidence worksheets, problem sets, and readings, as seen here.  

Use this space to include your installation screenshots.



### Portfolio repo setup
Detail the code you used to create, initialize, and push your portfolio repo to GitHub. This will be helpful as you will need to repeat many of these steps to update your porfolio throughout the course.



### RMarkdown pretty html challenge
Paste your code from the in-class activity of recreating the example html.



## Origins and Earth Systems
### Evidence worksheet 01 
The template for the first Evidence Worksheet has been included here. The first thing for any assignment should link(s) to any relevant literature (which should be included as full citations in a module references section below).

You can copy-paste in the answers you recorded when working through the evidence worksheet into this portfolio template. 

As you include Evidence worksheets and Problem sets in the future, ensure that you delineate Questions/Learning Objectives/etc. by using headers that are 4th level and greater. This will still create header markings when you render (knit) the document, but will exclude these levels from the Table of Contents. That's a good thing. You don't' want to clutter the Table of Contents too much.

#### Learning objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
* What were the main questions being asked?  

<b>Some of the main questions the author asked were:</b>  
What is the number of prokaryotes in different environments on Earth?  
What is the total number of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus on Earth?
How can you find these numbers? What strategies can be approached to find these numbers?
What are the limitations of these strategies?
How do these numbers affect the potential for genetic diversity?

* What were the primary methodological approaches used?  

A lot of the methodological approaches were finding cell counts and average cell counts. The authors also integrated data from other studies as well as extrapolated and estimated using those data. One concerning fact was that they used field studies that weren't published or verified. Specific examples of this included their estimation of Terrestrial subsurface prokaryotes from groundwater data.

* Summarize the main results or findings. 

The main findings include:
Prokaryotes are mostly found in three habitats - open ocean, soil and oceanic and terrestrial subsurface. Prokaryotes carbon globally is almost double the total the carbon in living organisms. For example, the total carbon of prokaryotes on Earth is approximately 60-100% the total carbon found in plants. They also have the genetic capacity to evolve and because their genes are widely distributed, this serves as a great opportunity for mutational change. 

* Do new questions arise from the results?  

Some questions that arise from these results include:
How can we explore the diversity of prokaryotes and what strategies can we use to find this? Are there better definitions for what defines a species in prokaryotes? How accurate are the estimates in the paper based on studies and extrapolation? How do we confirm these numbers? And why haven't we revisited these numbers with the new technology we have now?


* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  

The paper was challenging in the sense that a lot of data was thrown at you initially without much context. The authors only explained the global context later. They also didn't explain the methods of the studies where they took their data from or questioned the validity of the numbers they were using. Some of the studies were unpublished. 


### Problem set 01
#### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific questions:
* What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.  

Aquatic Environments (includes seawater, lakes, deep oceanic water any sort of enivronment with large bodies of water)
Fresh Water cell abundance is around 10x10^5 cells/mL
Continental Shelf is 5x10^5 Cells/mL same as open ocean upper 200m water
Ocean water below 200m is 0.5x10^5 cells/mL, and Ocean Sediment is 4600x10^5 cells/mL
Total 1.181 x 10^29 Cells

Subsurface (defined as terrestrial habitats below 8m and marine sediments below 10cm and prokaryote population is quite large, it’s mostly inorganic and only a subset of prokaryotes can survive) Deep oceans have more cell density compared to the continental shelf and coastal plains, and the deeper you go the less cells you have per cm^3 starting from 220 x 10^6 cells/cm^3 to 0.34 cells/cm^3  from 0.1m down to 3000 m down. Total 2.556 x 10^29 Cells


Soil (Major reservoir of organic carbon on earth and prokaryotes are essential to decomposition, also includes grasslands and cultivated soils)
Depending on what kind of soil (forest is around 0.3 to 0.6 x 10^27 cells/g of soil, other land including grass and cultivated, alpine, savanna woodland are upwards of 20.8 to 63 x 10^27 cells/g).

* What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth? 

The upper 200 m of ocean the cellular density is about 5x10^5 cells/mL and a portion of these cells are Prochlorococcus with an average cell density of 4x10^4 cells/mL (so it accounts for 8%). 

3.6 x 10^28 cells total found

This provides high turnover of prokaryotes and produces a large amount of carbon, four times their carbon content) and there is a net productivity of 85% at the upper 200 m of the ocean. So it also contributes significantly to the atmospheric composition of the Earth.

* What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?  

Autotroph - sustains itself using light energy since they’re only found on surface of the ocean, “self-nourishing” and fix inorganic carbon (CO2) which accumulates biomass

Heterotroph - consumes organic carbon to sustain itself

Lithotroph - consumes inorganic substrates to sustain itself.

* Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?  

Deepest is subsurface sediments at a depth of 3 to 4 km
The limiting factor at this depth is temperature since the average temperature reaches 125 degrees C which is the upper limit for supporting prokaryotic life.

* Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height? 

The highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life is air, they’ve been detected up to 57-77 km
Primary limiting factor is that there aren’t many nutrients or organic matter for that matter.

* Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth’s biosphere measured in km?  

81 km because of 77 km above land plus 4 km below land

If we only count Mount Everest as the top plus Mariana’s Trench (10.9 km) plus 4.5km below that then the total is 24km total. 

* How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation) 

365 days divided by turn over time (in days)
multiply that by population size

gives you cells/year

(Population x (turnover/yr) = cells/yr
[(3.6 x 10^28 cells)*365 days] / 16 turnovers = 8.2 x 10^29 cells/year. 

* What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?  

Carbon Much higher in top 200 m of ocean
because of photosynthesis at the top, bottom are feeding off of material the top prokaryotes make
Assuming carbon efficiency is 20%, and 20 fg of carbon/cell —even be around 20 x 10^-30 pg/cell
(3.6 x 10^28 cells) * (20 x 10^-30 pg of carbon/cell) = 0.72 Pg of Carbon in marine heteros
4 (turnover) x 0.72 Pg = 2.88 Pg/yr

turnover rate is also higher in the 200 m above the ocean 

It takes a lot longer (turnover time) in terrestrial habitats, whereas there’s an 85% productivity in oceanic prokaryotes 
51Pg of carbon/year with 85% consumed = 43 Pg C
(43 Pg c/Yr) / (2.88 Pg/year) = 14.4 or 1 turnover every 24.5 days. 

* How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10^-7^ per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)  

365 days/16 days for turnover = 22.8 turnover/yr
(3.6 x 10^28 cells) x 22.8 turnover/yr = 8.2 x 10^29 cells/yr
(4 x 10^-7)^4 mutations/generation = 2.56 x 10^-26 mut/gen (power to four because we want 4 mutations to happen simultaneously
(8.2 x 10^29) cells/yr x (2.56 x 10^-26) mut/year = 21,012 mut/yr
(8.7 x 10^3 hr/yr)/ (21012 mut/yr) = 0.4 mut/hr

* Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt? 

The more mutational potential and the higher the mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, the greater the genetic diversity possible for prokaryotes as well as a more advantageous adaptive potential

Other mutations are possible such as plasmid transfer, recombination, transformation, transduction..etc.

* What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text?

Abundance and rapid replication lead to high mutation rates which cause an increase in diversity of the prokaryotic population. The more diversity there is, the more potential to adapt to environmental stresses and also an increase in metabolic potential.

### Problem set_03 “Metagenomics: Genomic Analysis of Microbial Communities”
#### Learning objectives: 
Specific emphasis should be placed on the process used to find the answer. Be as comprehensive as possible e.g. provide URLs for web sources, literature citations, etc.  
*(Reminders for how to format links, etc in RMarkdown are in the RMarkdown Cheat Sheets)*

#### Specific Questions:

* **How many prokaryotic divisions have been described and how many have no cultured representatives (microbial dark matter)?**

2016: ~89 bacteria phyla, and 20 archael phyla via small 16S rRNA databases, but could be up to 1500 bacteria phyla. There are microbes that live in the "shadow biosphere". 

2003: ~26 of 52 major bacterial phyla have been cultivated, and there are probably more now. But there are still many undiscovered divisions. 
  

* **How many metagenome sequencing projects are currently available in the public domain and what types of environments are they sourced from?**

There are **many** metagenomic sequencing projects available in the public domain, up to thousands. For example 110,217 are found on the EBI database, and the ones that are there are always changing. They're also sourced from all types of enviornments (sediments, soil, gut aquatic...etc), especially those where it's hard to culture communities in lab settings. 
  

* **What types of on-line resources are available for warehousing and/or analyzing environmental sequence information (provide names, URLS and applications)?**  

For MLST, there is an online resource for identifying OTU identification. 
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275946089_Metagenomics_Tools_and_Insights_for_Analyzing_Next-Generation_Sequencing_Data_Derived_from_Biodiversity_Studies
The different categories include:

Shotgun Metagenomics:
- Assembly - for example EULER, Velvet

- Binning - ex. TETRA, MetaCluster

- Annotation - ex. FASTX-Toolkit, mOTU-LG

- Analysis pipeline - ex. CAMERA

Marker gene metagenomics:

- Standalone software - ex. OTUbase

- Analysis pipelines - ex. SILVA, CLOTU

- Denoising - ex. JATAC

- Databases - ex. RDP (Ribosomal Database Project)

* **What is the difference between phylogenetic and functional gene anchors and how can they be used in metagenome analysis?**   

Phylogenetic gene anchors are defined by things like vertical gene transfer, carrying phylogenetic information allowing tree reconstruction, single-copy, taxonomic. Functionall gene anchors have more horizontal gene transfer, and can identify specific biogeodom functions associated with measurable effects. But they are not as useful for phylogeny. 

* **What is metagenomic sequence binning? What types of algorithmic approaches are used to produce sequence bins? What are some risks and opportunities associated with using sequence bins for metabolic reconstruction of uncultivated microorganisms?**  

MEtagenomic binning is the process of grouping sequences that come from a single genome. The types of algorithms include (1) Aligning sequences to the database and (2) Grouping to each other based on DNA characteristics: GC content, codon usage. 

Some risks of binning include: incomplete coverage of genome sequence, contamination from different phylogeny. 

* **Is there an alternative to metagenomic shotgun sequencing that can be used to access the metabolic potential of uncultivated microorganisms? What are some risks and opportunities associated with this alternative?**  

Some alternatives include: functional screens (biochemical), 3rd gen sequencing (nanopore), single cell sequencing, FISH probe...etc.

    
### Problem set_04 “Fine-scale phylogenetic architecture”
#### Learning objectives: 

* Gain experience estimating diversity within a hypothetical microbial community

#### Part 1: Description and enumeration
Obtain a collection of "microbial" cells from "seawater". The cells were concentrated from different depth intervals by a marine microbiologist travelling along the Line-P transect in the northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean off the coast of Vancouver Island British Columbia. 

Sort out and identify different microbial "species" based on shared properties or traits. Record your data in this Rmarkdown using the example data as a guide.

Once you have defined your binning criteria, separate the cells using the sampling bags provided. These operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be considered separate "species". This problem set is based on content available at [What is Biodiversity](http://cnx.org/content/m12179/latest/).

For example, load in the packages you will use.
```{r message=FALSE}
#To make tables
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
#To manipulate and plot data
library(tidyverse)
```

Then load in the data. You should use a similar format to record your community data.
```{r}
example_data1 = data.frame(
  number = c(1,2,3),
  name = c("lion", "tiger", "bear"),
  characteristics = c("brown cat", "striped cat", "not a cat"),
  occurences = c(2, 4, 1)
)
```

Finally, use these data to create a table.
```{r}
example_data1 %>% 
  kable("html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10, full_width = F)
```
	
For your sample:

```{r}
#This is the population
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

diversity_candy = data.frame(
  number = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14),
  name = c("Skittles", "Vines", "Mikes & Ikes", "Bricks", "Gummy Bears", "M&M", "Sour Bears", "Sour Fruit", "Hershey Kisses", "Jujubes", "Sour Bottle", "Sour Swirl", "Wine Candy", "Sour Hexa"),
  characteristics = c("chewy sour candy", "red string candy", "rod shaped fruit candy", "brick shaped candy", "gummy bear candy", "circular chocolate candy", "sour bear candy", "sour fruit shaped candy", "cone shaped chocolate candy", "hard gummy candy", "sour bottle-shaped candy", "sour swirl candy", "wine candy", "sour 6-legged candy"),
  occurences = c(187, 14, 174, 18, 101, 241, 3, 2, 16, 24, 3, 3, 9, 6))

kable(diversity_candy, "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10, full_width = F)
```

* Construct a table listing each species, its distinguishing characteristics, the name you have given it, and the number of occurrences of the species in the collection.

```{r}
diversity_candy_sample = data.frame(
  number = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11),
  name = c("Skittles", "Vines", "Mikes & Ikes", "Bricks", "Gummy Bears", "M&M", "Hershey Kisses", "Jujubes", "Sour Swirl", "Wine Candy", "Sour Hexa"),
  characteristics = c("chewy sour candy", "red string candy", "rod shaped fruit candy", "brick shaped candy", "gummy bear candy", "circular chocolate candy", "cone shaped chocolate candy", "hard gummy candy", "sour swirl candy", "wine candy", "sour 6-legged candy"),
  occurences = c(49, 8, 40, 3, 23, 44, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2))

kable(diversity_candy_sample, "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", font_size = 10, full_width = F)
```

* Ask yourself if your collection of microbial cells from seawater represents the actual diversity of microorganisms inhabiting waters along the Line-P transect. Were the majority of different species sampled or were many missed? 
 
#### Part 2: Collector's curve
To help answer the questions raised in Part 1, you will conduct a simple but informative analysis that is a standard practice in biodiversity surveys. This analysis involves constructing a collector's curve that plots the cumulative number of species observed along the y-axis and the cumulative number of individuals classified along the x-axis. This curve is an increasing function with a slope that will decrease as more individuals are classified and as fewer species remain to be identified. If sampling stops while the curve is still rapidly increasing then this indicates that sampling is incomplete and many species remain undetected. Alternatively, if the slope of the curve reaches zero (flattens out), sampling is likely more than adequate.

To construct the curve for your samples, choose a cell within the collection at random. This will be your first data point, such that X = 1 and Y = 1. Next, move consistently in any direction to a new cell and record whether it is different from the first. In this step X = 2, but Y may remain 1 or change to 2 if the individual represents a new species. Repeat this process until you have proceeded through all cells in your collection.

For example, we load in these data.
```{r}
example_data2 = data.frame(
  x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10),
  y = c(1,2,3,4,4,5,5,5,6,6)
)
```
My own data:

```{r}
candy_sample_collector_ = data.frame(x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175),
  y = c(1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,6,7,8,8,9,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11,11)
)

```
And then create a plot. We will use a scatterplot (geom_point) to plot the raw data and then add a smoother to see the overall trend of the data.
```{r}
ggplot(example_data2, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x="Cumulative number of individuals classified", y="Cumulative number of species observed")
```

My plot:

```{r}
ggplot(candy_sample_collector_, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="loess") +
  labs(x="Cumulative number of individuals classified", y="Cumulative number of species observed")

```
For your sample:

* Create a collector's curve.
* Does the curve flatten out? If so, after how many individual cells have been collected?
* What can you conclude from the shape of your collector's curve as to your depth of sampling?

#### Part 3: Diversity estimates (alpha diversity)
Using the table from Part 1, calculate species diversity using the following indices or metrics.

##### Diversity: Simpson Reciprocal Index

$\frac{1}{D}$ where $D = \sum p_i^2$

$p_i$ = the fractional abundance of the $i^{th}$ species

For example, using the example data 1 with 3 species with 2, 4, and 1 individuals each, D =

```{r}
species1 = 2/(2+4+1)
species2 = 4/(2+4+1)
species3 = 1/(2+4+1)

1 / (species1^2 + species2^2 + species3^2)
```

The higher the value is, the greater the diversity. The maximum value is the number of species in the sample, which occurs when all species contain an equal number of individuals. Because the index reflects the number of species present (richness) and the relative proportions of each species with a community (evenness), this metric is a diveristy metric. Consider that a community can have the same number of species (equal richness) but manifest a skewed distribution in the proportion of each species (unequal evenness), which would result in different diveristy values.

* What is the Simpson Reciprocal Index for your sample?

```{r}
species1 = 49/175
species2 = 8/175
species3 = 40/175
species4 = 3/175
species5 = 23/175
species6 = 44/175
species7 = 2/175

##### Richness: Chao1 richness estimator
Another way to calculate diversity is to estimate the number of species that are present in a sample based on the empirical data to give an upper boundary of the richness of a sample. Here, we use the Chao1 richness estimator. 

$S_{chao1} = S_{obs} + \frac{a^2}{2b})$

$S_{obs}$ = total number of species observed
a = species observed once
b = species observed twice or more

So for our previous example community of 3 species with 2, 4, and 1 individuals each, $S_{chao1}$ =

```{r}
3 + 1^2/(2*2)
```

* What is the chao1 estimate for your sample?

```{r}
11 + 6^2/(2*5)

##Ans = 14.6
```

#### Part 4: Alpha-diversity functions in R
We've been doing the above calculations by hand, which is a very good exercise to aid in understanding the math behind these estimates. Not surprisingly, these same calculations can be done with R functions. Since we just have a species table, we will use the `vegan` package. You will need to install this package if you have not done so previously. 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(vegan)
```

First, we must remove the unnecesary data columns and transpose the data so that `vegan` reads it as a species table with species as columns and rows as samples (of which you only have 1).
```{r}
example_data1_diversity = 
  example_data1 %>% 
  select(name, occurences) %>% 
  spread(name, occurences) 

example_data1_diversity
```

Then we can calculate the Simpson Reciprocal Index using the `diversity` function.
```{r}
diversity(example_data1_diversity, index="invsimpson")
```

And we can calculate the Chao1 richness estimator (and others by default) with the the `specpool` function for extrapolated species richness. This function rounds to the nearest whole number so the value will be slightly different that what you've calculated above.
```{r}
specpool(example_data1_diversity)
```

In Project 1, you will also see functions for calculating alpha-diversity in the `phyloseq` package since we will be working with data in that form.

For your sample:

* What is the Simpson Reciprocal Index using the R function?

```{r}
diversity_candy_diversity =
  diversity_candy %>% 
  select(name, occurences) %>% 
  spread(name, occurences)

diversity_candy_diversity

diversity(diversity_candy_diversity, index="invsimpson")
## [1] 4.75165
```
* What is the chao1 estimate using the R function?

```{r}
specpool(diversity_candy_diversity)
## chao = 14
```
    + Verify that these values match your previous calculations.

#### Part 5: Concluding activity
If you are stuck on some of these final questions, reading the [Kunin et al. 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19725865) and [Lundin et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23760801) papers may provide helpful insights. 

* How does the measure of diversity depend on the definition of species in your samples?
* Can you think of alternative ways to cluster or bin your data that might change the observed number of species?
* How might different sequencing technologies influence observed diversity in a sample?

### Module 01 Writing Assignment

**Opening**

From the beginning of the Earth’s start, microbes have developed as well as grow the various biogeochemical cycles of the environment. As humans continue to contribute to the global warming phenomenon and release hazardous chemicals into various habitats, microbes have been there to react and adapt to the changing circumstances. If we slowly destroy the habitat at a pace that microbes cannot adapt to, then we will not be able to ensure our own survival. Microbes have been vital to shaping the earth’s biogeochemical cycles throughout the centuries. Humans cannot completely cover the extent of microbial actions to ameliorate the environment. For so long we’ve relied on the global catalysis and environmental transformations that microbes provide, we will not be able to survive without microbial life. In this essay, I will explore these themes and prove that humans cannot survive without the help of microbes and their various processes. 
	
**Microbes shape the cycles of the Earth**

There is no doubt that microbes have shaped the Earth since the early Archaen period, developing the cycles we know today like the nitrogen cycle, oxygen cycle…etc. The production of oxygen, something that all humans need and cannot live without, was mainly done by microbes. Marine photosynthesis by single cell organisms is a net source of O2 on Earth (Kasting and Siefert 1066). This oxygen is created by the reaction: CO2 + H2O  CH2O + O2 where CH2O is shorthand for complex organic matter (Kasting and Siefert 1066). The initial rise of atmospheric O2 was caused by a primitive cyanobacteria at least 2.3 billion years ago even though the process of oxygenic photosynthesis is extremely complicated (Kasting and Siefert 1066). Even though humans have comprehensive and multi-faceted technology, it is almost impossible for us to replicate such a complex system from scratch. 

Another important cycle that microbes contribute to is the nitrogen cycle. The biosphere needs incorporation of nitrogen into biological molecules which is why prokaryotes are truly vital for their ability to reduce nitrogen gas (N2) to ammonium (Canfield et. Al 192). It is suggested that anoxygenic phototrophs contributed to the flux of nutrients and carbon through the biosphere (Canfield et. Al 193). And due to this, Nitrogen limitation would cause selective pressure anoxygenic phototrophs to fix N2 (Canfield et al. 193). This happened early on in biological evolution in anaerobic photoautotrophs under the domain Bacteria (Canfield et. Al 193). Without this important process, many current organisms and biological processes would not be possible – including human life. 
	
Other important pathways include the major biogeochemical fluxes, or in other words the biological fluxes of H, C, N, O, S which are largely driven by microbes (Falkowski et al. 1034). These thermodynamically constrained redox reactions have evolved so that they only require limited external energy to sustain the cycling of these major chemicals (Falkowski et al. 1034). Sulphate and Sulphur respiration as well as iron respiration cycles are mediated by many microbes, often in anaerobic habitats (Falkowski et al. 1034). As we can see, the prevalence of so many central biogeochemical cycles are due to the many microbes that support the chemical reactions. Humans are dependent on these pathways that maintain the Earth’s habitable environment, but we cannot provide support like the microbes do. 

**Humans cannot replicate microbial actions**

Despite the many planetary boundary and intervention techniques humans try to take in order to ameliorate the damage that has already been caused, we cannot adapt and stretch our technology to cover the entirety of the Earth’s atmosphere as microbes do. According to Whitman et al., the number of prokaryotes in the open ocean is around 1.2 x 1029 cells (Whitman et. Al 6578). Of course, these numbers may be inaccurate, but imagine this large number of cells that contribute to oxidative photosynthesis described above, shaping the oxygenic atmosphere that many organisms require. The cellular production rate for prokaryotes is estimated at 1.7 x 1030 cells/year, with the highest rate at the open ocean (Whitman et. al 6578). This enormous contribution of microbes to the atmosphere seems impossible to replicate or even adapt at the microbial pace. 

The techniques and methods that humans have in place to restore the planet’s environment are meek at best. Johan Rockstrom speaks on the framework of planetary boundaries that humans should operate within to respect the Earth’s biophysical processes (472). These thresholds are essentially a critical value for control variables, like CO2 concentration, which we have to maintain in order to contain an already teetering global environment from completely breaking down (Rockstrom 472). The Earth’s biodiversity is so complex that setting such an arbitrary boundary is difficult (Rockstrom 474). And because of microbes and various species that support the ecosystem, we cannot know for sure how much biodiversity can be lost before the Earth’s resilience erodes (Rockstrom 474). The entire argument that humans can restore the ecology of the Earth rests on the our ability to understand the “scale of human action in relation to the capacity of the Earth to sustain it” (Rockstrom 474). Without complete understanding and capacity to change what’s broken, humans will never have the opportunity to reverse global climate change. 

**Humans depend on microbial processes**

Humans are directly dependent on many of the elements of the biogeochemical cycles described above. We will not survive without the existence of microbes. The reason for increasing large scale environmental pollution is due to modern agriculture (Rockstrom 474). Because we require the presence of nitrogen as fertilizers in our crops, we have slowly but surely poisoned the soil and seas with excessive nutrients. The manufacturing of fertilizer for food products convert up to 120 million tonnes of N2 from the atmosphere (Rockstrom 474). Phosphorus, a result of geological processes, is also mined from rock for humans to use as fertilizer or even toothpaste (Rockstrom 474). It goes without saying that humans and countless other organisms require oxygen in the air we breathe in order for basic survival. Man is at the top of the pyramid of life, but each successive layer depends on the ones below it for food and biological services (Leopold 8).

Many of these mined or converted chemicals are disposed in the environment causing a buildup of even more environmental damage. Marine ecosystems take the brunt of these anthropogenic distortions of nitrogen and phosphorus cycles (Rockstrom 474). Reactive oxygen pollutes waterways, coastal zones and land systems, thereby contributing to gases in the atmosphere (Rockstrom 474). 9.5 million tonnes of phosphorus also end up in oceans, eight times its normal background rate of influx (Rockstrom 474). We use the resources that microbes provide, but we do not take care to restore or maintain the pathways in which we take chemicals from. 

**Closing**

Microbes are essential to the survival of humans and other organisms, but humans are not essential for the survival of all life on Earth. The various biogeochemical cycles like oxygen and nitrogen pathways are evolved and shaped to what they are today by microbes. And because there are massive quantities of microbes in the ecosystem, there is no possibility that human advancement in technology could ever replicate the actions or take the place of microbes. We cannot even guarantee our own survival without the presence of microbes since we are largely reliant on microbial pathways for survival. Humans take nutrients from the environment and disrupt the processes we take them from. Should we adhere to the boundaries we have set ourselves to follow in order to try to slow down the Earth’s eroding ecosystem? Or should we try to understand the various microbial pathways that contribute to this ecosystem even better to come up with a solution? Will we ever fully understand the complexities of the Earth’s ecosystem to change anything significantly? These questions can only be answered by testing our perseverance and commitment to find a long-lasting solution to climate change.
